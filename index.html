                        Miki Moriguchi specializes in traditional
                        Japanese-style acupuncture techniques. She
                        uses extremely fine Japanese needles which are
                        rarely used in other styles of acupuncture.
                        Treatments are gentle and usually painless, yet
                        very effective.

                    Oriental and Western medicine each have their strengths, which 
                    is why both systems are used by medical practitioners in Japan 
                    and China. Traditional Oriental medicine is most effective for 
                    chronic conditions and routine health problems, especially those 
                    that don't seem to respond to Western remedies.

                        <p>
                            Acupuncture works even without the
                            patient "believing" that it will. We know this
                            from testing it on animals with successful
                            results.
                        </p>
                        <p>    
                            It has been shown that acupuncture
                            strengthens the immune system by increasing
                            T-cell counts. This may be why it works on
                            allergies and chronic fatigue syndrome.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Increased circulation and healing allows
                            acupuncture to work well for repetitive stress
                            injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome and
                            wrist tendonitis radiating to the neck.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Acupuncture releases pain-killing
                            <i>endorphins</i>, which also play a big role in the
                            functioning of the hormonal system. This is
                            why acupuncture works well for back pain and
                            arthritis, and also for P.M.S. and ulcers.
                            These <b><i>endorphins</i></b> not only relax the
                            whole body when released, but they regulate
                            serotonin in the brain which plays a big part in
                            our moods. This is why they treat depression
                            and schizophrenia with acupuncture in Japan
                            and China.

                        <p>
                            Acupuncture breaks the spasm cycle
                            which muscles can get caught in, causing
                            unrelenting tightness and pain. It does this by
                            increasing circulation, which in turn provides
                            needed nutrients to nerves and muscles to
                            begin the healing process.

                        <p>
                            The <b>traditional explanation</b> for how acupuncture works 
                            is as follows: there is an unceasing
                            flow of “life energy" called “ki” which runs
                            throughout the human body. This vital energy
                            originates from the major organs and flows
                            along continuous circulatory channels called
                            meridians. Along these meridians are areas
                            where the energy comes close to the surface,
                            creating acupuncture points.
                            We tap into these points to balance the energy
                            which connects all of your organs.
                            energy must flow smoothly.
                            If your organs do not work in balance,
                            you will be sick - either now or in the future!
                        </p>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>
                            Before each treatment, Miki will evaluate your health 
                            by asking you questions about how you feel. She may ask
                            to see your tongue, feel your pulse, or palpate
                            your abdomen.
                        </p>
                        <p>  
                            The color and texture of the tongue can show
                            how the body is functioning. your pulse
                            shows the strength and the balance of your
                            organs. "Facial diagnosis" is often part of this
                            evaluation. For example, darkness around
                            the eyes is a kidney imbalance, redness of
                            the nose is a liver imbalance, and yellowish
                            coloring around the mouth is a spleen or
                            frequently a hormonal imbalance.

                        <p>
                            Only <b>disposable needles</b> are used.
                            The needles are as fine as a human hair and
                            are tapped in through a tiny tube.
                            Most patients do not even feel the needles.
                            The acupuncture points are stimulated with
                            mostly shallow insertion and generally provide
                            a relaxing and soothing experience.
                            The needles are usually left in for 15 to 20
                            minutes, during which time the patient relaxes
                            under a heat lamp while soft music plays.
                            Many patients fall asleep due to the relaxing
                            <i>endorphins</i> that are released.

                            Each patient is unique. the number and
                            frequency of treatments will vary from patient to
                            patient. Some symptoms are relieved after
                            the first treatment, while others may take four

                            on, you may visit the acupuncturist once or
                            twice a week, and gradually reduce the
                            frequency to once or twice a month.

                            Traditional Oriental medicine (which includes acupuncture) dates back 
                            3000 years to <b>Japan</b>, Korea, India, Tibet and China. Traditional 
                            Oriental medicine has gained worldwide acceptance and recognition.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The World Health Organization recognizes acupuncture as an effective 
                            medical treatment, stating the sheer weight of evidence demands that 
                            acupuncture must be taken seriously as a clinical procedure of 
                            considerable value.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Acupuncture associations and study groups are active in many countries, 
                            including the United States, France, Germany, Britain, Switzerland, 
                            Italy, Russia, Argentina, Japan, China and Korea. In addition, many 
                            nations support active research programs in the physiology and therapy 
                            of acupuncture. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The State of California recognizes licensed acupuncturists as primary 
                            health care providers. Licenses are issued only after completion of a 
                            three- to four-year course of post-graduate study and the passing of an 
                            extensive examination.

                            Over 12 million Americans have turned to acupuncture. Oriental medicine 
                            is becoming the complementary treatment of choice for Americans everywhere. 
                            Although traditional Oriental medicine uses many approaches, including diet, 
                            nutritional supplements, and massage, its cornerstones are acupuncture and 
                            herbal medicine. Also employed is <i><b>moxibustion</b> (a heat treatment)</i> and cupping 
                            to improve circulation. Herbal supplements may be recommended to complement 
                            treatment.
